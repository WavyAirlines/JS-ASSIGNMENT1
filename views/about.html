<h1 class="text-light">About me</h1>
    <p class="text-light">I am a 20 Year old Interactive Media Design-web student with asperations to become a UX/UI designer. In my spare time I am at the gym, coding, investing, or playing video games. From a young age ive had an intrest in computer programming, when I was a kid I would always ask my parents for a computer for christmas. At this point I just thought computers were cool and unknown but now Ive realized that this is what I want my carreer to be.After studying Interactive media design I fell in love with the feeling of finishing hard blocks of code that I spent a lot of time frustrated with troubleshooting. This is the same feeling that makes it easy to wake up in the early mornings and get it done. </p>
